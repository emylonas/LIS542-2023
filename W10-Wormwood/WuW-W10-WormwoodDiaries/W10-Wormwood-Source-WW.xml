Went to Mr. <name role="music teacher"><lastName>Strate</lastName></name>'s. Had music. Laughed at <name><firstName>Joe</firstName></name> and <name><firstName>Charlie</firstName></name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name><firstName>Charlie</firstName></name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the <place type="relative">creek</place>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young."

After <place type="relative">school</place> I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the <place type="relative">bridge</place> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <cite type="newspaper"><place type="absolute">Modesto</place> paper</cite>. <name><firstName>Jesse</firstName></name> tried to make us believe he could not read.

Gave us oranges. <name><firstName>Dolly</firstName></name> and I went to church with <name><firstName>Ed</firstName></name>.

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. <name role="music teacher"><lastName>Strate</lastName></name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after <place type="relative">school</place> is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <name role="mother"><nickName>mamma</nickName></name> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name><firstName>Jess</firstName></name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
