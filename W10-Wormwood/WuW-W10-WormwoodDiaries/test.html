                Had good <span class="place">school</span>. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <span class="name">Irwin</span> and <span class="name">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <span class="name">Lou</span> and <span class="name">Lillie</span> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <span class="name">Lillie</span>'s watch back with mine. – <span class="name">Jesse</span> laughs at me about being always hungry. <span class="name">Nellie</span> and <span class="name">Mary</span> went to <span class="place">church</span>. <span class="name">J</span> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be</p>
            
             
        [Pagethree]
    <p>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the <span class="place">school</span> house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to Mr. <span class="name">Strate</span>'s. Had music. Laughed at <span class="name">Joe</span> and <span class="name">Charlie</span> about going to "Hunt"('s) <span class="name">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the <span class="place">creek</span>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <span class="name">John</span> <span class="name">Dollie</span> and I came across the <span class="place">pasture</span>. (<span class="name">Dollie</span> thought we were going to <span class="place">China</span>.) <span class="name">Joe</span> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <span class="name">Peek</span>'s brought <span class="name">Mary</span> and <span class="name">Nellie</span> home. <span class="name">John Whitehouse</span> was converted.

    <h2/><p>January 31st. Friday.
                Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <span class="name">Irwin</span>, <span class="name">Walter</span>,<span class="name"> Charlie</span>,<span class="name"> Roy</span> + <span class="name">John</span> went down the <span class="place">road</span> and came back after <span class="place">school</span> had called. <span class="name">Roy</span> and <span class="name">John</span> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After <span class="place">school</span> I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the <span class="place">bridge</span> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <a href=""><span class="place">Modesto</span> paper</a>. <span class="name">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

    <p> argument; read two chapters from the <a href="">Testament</a>, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <span class="name">Lillie</span> did not come to <span class="place">school</span>.</p>
            <h2/><p>February 1st. Saturday
                Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the <span class="place">Local Institute</span>. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name">Nellie</span> about <span class="place">school</span>. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span class="name">Jesse</span> went to Modesto. <span class="name">Roy</span> cut wood. <span class="name">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span class="name">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span class="name">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from <span class="name">Mamma</span>, <span class="name">Ida</span> and <span class="name">Katie M</span>. got school journal and circular from supt. <span class="name">McClure</span>.</p>

    <p>told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <span class="place">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <span class="name">Joe</span> came home with <span class="name">Jess</span>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span class="name">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to <span class="place">town</span>. As they were starting, <span class="name">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <span class="name">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span class="name">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span class="name">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="name">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <span class="name">Lillie</span> came to tell us about going over</p>
            
             
        [Pageseven]
    <p>to <span class="place">Scottsville</span> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span class="name">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <span class="name">Dollie</span> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>
            <h2/><p>February 2nd. Sunday.
                Rainy and dark. <span class="name">Jess</span> went away. <span class="name">Charie Crawford</span> came. I read story of "<a href="">Howard and his Teacher</a>". Laughed about "<a href="">Love in the Kitchen</a>"; also "<a href="">Love in the Front-room</a>." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span class="name">Roy</span> and I took down items; and <span class="name">Joe</span> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <span class="name">Roy</span> but <span class="name">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <span class="name">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

            <p>lot. <span class="name">Dolly</span> went to put <span class="name">Joe</span>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <span class="name">Jess</span> says <span class="name">Flo</span> is the only good looking girl in <span class="place">Illinois</span>. Mr. <span class="name">Essex</span>, the best looking man. <span class="place">Kentucky</span> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <span class="name">Jess</span> says "<span class="name">Dollie</span> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <span class="name">Roy</span>, <span class="name">Nellie</span> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet. </p>
            <h2/><p>February 3rd.    Monday.
                Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>

    <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. <span class="name">Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after <span class="place">school</span> is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <span class="name">mamma</span> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
