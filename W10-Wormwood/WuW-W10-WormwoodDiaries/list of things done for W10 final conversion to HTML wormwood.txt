-added attribute @type to element <cite>, with any possible string value, such as <cite type="newspaper">.
-Marked up document to cite stuff.

-Marked up all the places with the new attribute. 
-Added list of places with attributes values at end of html.

	-Rendering took a while: 20 minutes. Looks sort of messy. Will try to fix. 
	-The blog page is in the process of updating, I will try to update later when I have the chance. Version 1 is from around 2:20pm 2023-Jun-04. 

-Made list of names not double spaced: turns out it was a COMMENT inserted between the lines of code that was making it double spaced... what a dumb oversight. 



TO DO TASKS:
-How to delete repeating names and places? 
	-Ok it's been two hours and I still can't figure this one out. I've looked at Oreily, Stackoverflow, and ChatGpt, and nothing is giving me a clear answer. 
		-Secondly, how to count how many times a name or a place appears in the lists????

-Why is there a --> arrow at the end of the html document?
