                <date when="1896-01-31"> January 31st. Friday.</date>
            <p> Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>, <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote saidBy="Unknown">"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> <alternates><sic>A</sic><corr>As</corr></alternates> I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks.

                <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date>
                <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to Modesto. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.</p>

            <p>told about hauling one of my pupils <marginalia locationVerticle="top" locationHorizontal="right"><alternates><illegible>Jermin</illegible></alternates></marginalia> around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about <quote saidBy="Jess">"Back woodsers"</quote> and <quote saidBy="Jess">"Mountain heathens"</quote>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over</p>

                <p> to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <name>Kentucky</name> is noted for <resource>tobacco</resource>, <resource>whiskey</resource> and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says <quote saidBy="Jess">"<name>Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right."</quote> <quote saidBy="Jess">"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are <quote saidBy="Jess">"Smart alecks."</quote> I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p>
                <date when="1896-02-03">February 3rd.    Monday.</date>
                <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>
            
         <pb n="p09"/>
            
                <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <name>mamma</name> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
