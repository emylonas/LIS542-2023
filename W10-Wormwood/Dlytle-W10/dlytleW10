            <p> Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <span class="name">Irwin</span> and <span class="name">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey."

Laughed at <span class="name">Joe</span> and <span class="name">Charlie</span> about going to "<span class="name">Hunt</span>"('s) <span class="name">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <span class="name">John</span> <span class="name">Dollie</span> and I came across the pasture.

                <h2> January 31st. Friday.</h2>
            <p> Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <span class="name">Irwin</span>, <span class="name">Walter</span>, <span class="name">Charlie</span>, <span class="name">Roy</span> + <span class="name">John</span> went down the road and came back after school had called. <span class="name">Roy</span> and <span class="name">John</span> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A<span class="modern">As</span> I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <span class="name">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "<span class="modern"/>scripture</p>

            <p> argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <span class="name">Lillie</span> did not come to school.</p>
            
                <h2>February 1st. Saturday</h2>
                <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name">Nellie</span> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span class="name">Jesse</span> went to Modesto. <span class="name">Roy</span> cut wood. <span class="name">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span class="name">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span class="name">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from <span class="name">Mamma</span>, <span class="name">Ida</span> and <span class="name">Katie M.</span> got school journal and circular from supt. <span class="name">McClure</span>.</p>

            <p>told about hauling one of my pupils <i>
            In the Margins: Jermin?
    </i> around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <span class="place">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <span class="name">Joe</span> came home with <span class="name">Jess</span>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span class="name">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <span class="name">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <span class="name">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span class="name">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span class="name">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="name">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <span class="name">Lillie</span> came to tell us about going over</p>

                <p> to <span class="place">Scottsville</span> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span class="name">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <span class="name">Dollie</span> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>
            
                <h2>February 2nd. Sunday.</h2>
            <p> Rainy and dark. <span class="name">Jess</span> went away. <span class="name">Charie Crawford</span> came. I read story of "<span class="name">Howard</span> and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span class="name">Roy</span> and I took down items; and <span class="name">Joe</span> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to Roy but <span class="name">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <span class="name">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <span class="name">Jess</span> says <span class="name">Flo</span> is the only good looking girl in <span class="place">Illinois</span>. <span class="name">Mr. Essex</span>, the best looking man. <span class="name">Kentucky</span> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <span class="name">Jess</span> says "<span class="name">Dollie</span> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <span class="name">Roy</span>, <span class="name">Nellie</span> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p>
                <h2>February 3rd.    Monday.</h2>
                <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>
            
            
        [p. 9]
        
            
                <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <span class="name">mamma</span> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
