            <p>Pretty day. Had good school. Lou<name role="student"/> went home at last recess. They laughed about "Scratch" bringing Rose<name role="student"/> home. A. class drew map of <place type="country">Italy</place>, on board. In B. Geog. I asked how high is the highest peak in</p>
<pb n="p02"/>
            <p>the <place type="country">U.S.</place>, and had to laugh. We walked to meeting at the Baptist church. <name role="reverend">King</name> preached about <bible book="John" verse="8:12">"The light of the world"</bible>. Three boys went forward. I got letter from Miss Riefenberg.<name role="acquaintance"/></p></entry>

            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="acquaintance">Lou</name> and <name role="acquaintance">Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening <group type="organization" priv="private">Society</group> met. – Turned Lillie's watch back with mine. – <name role="family">Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name role="family">Nellie</name> and <name role="family">Mary</name> went to church. J called us <profanity type="slur">"Back woodsers"</profanity> I replied, that I would rather be</p>

            <p>a "backwoodser" than a <profanity type="slur">"heathen"</profanity>. We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name role="acquaintance">Mr. Strate's</name>. Had music. Laughed at Joe<name role="student"/> and Charlie<name role="student"/> about going to "Hunt"('s) Charlie has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. John Dollie<name role="family"/> and I came across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to <place type="country">China</place>.) Joe asked what I had been saying about <group type="demonym">Kentuckians</group>. Peek's brought Mary and Nellie home. <name role="acquaintance">John Whitehouse</name> was converted. (John W. came to <place type="building">school</place> this evening for Lou and Lillie.</p></entry>

            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name type="aquaintance">Irwin</name>, <name type="aquaintance">Walter</name>, <name type="aquaintance">Charlie</name>, <name type="aquaintance">Roy</name> + <name type="aquaintance">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. Roy and John tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place type="village">Modesto</place> paper. <name type="aquaintance">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

<p>argument; read two chapters from the <bible>Testament</bible>, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <profanity type="slur">"backwoodsers."</profanity> We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p></entry>

                <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place type="village">Nilwood</place> to the <place type="building">Local Institute</place>. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name type="aquaintance">Jesse</name> went to <place type="village">Modesto</place>. <name type="aquaintance">Roy</name> cut wood. <name type="aquaintance">Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name type="family">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name type="aquaintance">Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name role="family">Mamma</name>, <name type="aquaintance">Ida</name> and <name type="aquaintance">Katie M</name>. got school journal and circular from <name type="aquaintance">supt. McClure</name>.</p>

                <p>told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place type="village">Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name type="family">Joe</name> came home with <name type="family">Jess</name>. Argued about <profanity type="slur">"Back woodsers"</profanity> and <profanity type="slur">"Mountain heathens"</profanity>. They said <name type="family">Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, Joe was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to church with <name type="aquaintance">Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name type="reverend">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name type="aquaintance">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name type="aquaintance">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over</p>
<pb n="p07"/>
<p>to <place type="village">Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted Dollie to take her part in the dialogue. Asked Dollie to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p></entry>

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name type="family">Jess</name> says <name type="aquaintance">Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place type="state">Illinois</place>. <name type="aquaintance">Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place type="state">Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name type="family">Jess</name> says <q>"<name type="family">Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right."

<p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>

                <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. Strate<name role="acquaintance"/>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <name type="family">mamma</name> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name type="family">Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p></entry>
