A. class drew map of <place>Italy</place>, on board.

We walked to meeting at the <place>Baptist church</place>. <name>King</name> preached about "<quote cite="King">The life of the world</quote>." Three boys went forward.

            <p>Had good school. <weather>Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon</weather>. At noon <name>Irwin</name> and <name>Roy</name> tried to see who could act the <quote cite="Irwin and Roy">biggest monkey.</quote> Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and-so-forth. <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name>Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name>Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name> went to <place>church</place>. <name>J</name> called us "<quote cite="J">Back woodsers</quote>." I replied, that I would rather be<pb n="p03"/>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". <emphasis>We</emphasis> went down to the <place>school house</place>. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name>Mr. Strate</name>'s. Had music. Laughed at <name>Joe</name> and <name>Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name>Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the <place>creek</place>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was <weather>raining</weather>. <name>John</name> <name>Dollie</name> and I came across the <place>pasture</place>. (<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name>Peek</name>'s brought <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted.

Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>, <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote cite="undefined">Nothing. <emphasis>Not a thing</emphasis>, they just took a notion to be mean.</quote> As I came across the <place>bridge</place> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture<pb n="page05"/>argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <quote cite="Jesse">backwoodsers.</quote> We went to bed early. <name>Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>
            
            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday.</date>
            <p><weather>Dark and gloomy</weather>. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.<pb n="page06"/>told about hauling one of my pupils<marginalia location="top margin over word 'pupils'">(<name>Jermin</name>?)</marginalia> around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on <alternates><abbr>Tues.</abbr><expan>Tuesday</expan></alternates>, following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to <place>town</place>. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to <place>church</place> with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over<pb n="page07"/>to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>
            
            <date when="1896-02-02">February 2nd. Sunday.</date>
            <p><weather>Rainy and dark</weather>. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie Crawford</name> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." (<quote cite="Love in the Front-room">I'd get it and keep it</quote>.) <name>Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the <place>bed room</place>. threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in <place>little bed room</place> to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the <place>milk house</place> and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the<pb n="page08"/><marginalia location="top margin"><name>Irwin Baptist</name> is 16 years old today.</marginalia><place>lot</place>. <name>Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to <emphasis>stand on the bench</emphasis>. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that <emphasis>bake is</emphasis> right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says <quote cite="Jess"><name>Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right.</quote> <quote cite="Jess">She's too smart to be called a backwoodser.</quote> <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It <weather>snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet</weather>. </p>
            
            <date when="1896-02-03">February 3rd. Monday.</date>
            <p><weather>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</weather><pb n="page09"/>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <name>mamma</name> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
