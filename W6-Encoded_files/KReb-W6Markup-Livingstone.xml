                    <lb/>  <persName type="addressee"> My Dear Brother</persName> 
                <lb/>I was very much gratified
                <lb/> indeed by the reception of the kind favour you
                <lb/> sent by Mr Lennie *blotted out*s I am just about
                <lb/> to cross the boundary of comparative civilizat
                <lb/>-ion in order to visit the Interior I should be
                <lb/>sorry did I not give you a word in
                <lb/> passing by way of acknowledgment.
                <lb/>An answer it cannot be for I have
                <lb/> unfortunately left yours behind at Kuru
                <lb/>-man But I hope you will receive it such
                <lb/> as it is with forbearance
                <lb/>I am most happy to hear the heart
                <lb/>enlivening accounts of the state of your
                <lb/>missions among the Bassoutos, you
                <lb/>have been very highly favoured, May the
                <lb/>Lord grant that you be blessed still
                <lb/>more **Gap, illegible**that you may not only become
                <lb/> the benefactors of the people among
                <lb/>whom you at present are But that
                <lb/>by means of them you may become
                <lb/>blessings to many beyond you in the
                <lb/>Interior. Many being raised up by your
                <lb/>*gap, illegible* instrumentality to spread the knowledge
                <lb/>I expect to return (gap, 1 char) in about 4 months. If you kindly write
                <lb/>so that I receive it on my return [and] I shall be glad,     My friend you
                <lb/>try [and] decipher putting in words awanting try [and] leaving out those which ought
                <lb/>never to have
                <lb/>30 been in
                    <lb/>D.L.

                <p>
                    <lb/>of the everlasting gospel. Mrs L has no
                    <lb/>doubt given you an account of the state
                    <lb/>of affairs here at K.    The aspect of
                    <lb/>The\Mission is not so wanting as one might
                    <lb/> expect   But still the change which has been
                    <lb/>affected in a portion of this people is very
                    <lb/>great indeed.     It is not such as would
                    <lb/>strike a visitor from Europe or the Colony
                    <lb/>with any thing but disapointment, particular[  ]
                    <lb/>if he had heard the accounts of it which
                    <lb/>the good Christians in England by usually
                    <lb/>do   But after one sees the depths from
                    <lb/>which they have been elevated exemplified
                    <lb/>in the Interior tribes there is considerable
                    <lb/>cause for Thanksgiving     By the way when
                    <lb/>I think of the degradation of these people I shall
                    <lb/>be glad if you wil let me know if you
                    <lb/>believe they are really so very far sunk
                    <lb/>as has been represented, I heard Mr Moffat
                    <lb/>say in England that the Bechuanas had
                    <lb/>really no conscience until it was formed
                    <lb/>by the missionaries, Now although the
                    <lb/>statement excited my risible faculties a
                    <lb/>little at the time   thinking it was only a
                    <lb/>poetical figure expressive of the wonderful
                    <lb/>creative powers of us Sentelings   The same
                    <lb/>statement nearly appearing in his book</p>
                <pb facs="liv_000521" n="0003"/>
                <p>
                    <lb/>as I understand inclines me now to believe
                    <lb/>that it was meant as plain prose. What
                    <lb/>do you say as to their belief? I mean of the
                    <lb/>Bechuanas in relation to God. Futurely .
                    <lb/>Besides other fragments of knowledge which
                    <lb/>I have found among them they seem to have
                    <lb/>had the idea of the future existence clearly
                    <lb/>For instance what else than this idea can we
                    <lb/>deduce from the fable of the Cameleon 
                    <lb/> dark lizard, I heard Imokhuana in an
                    <lb/>address reason thus, "Is it not a fact that
                    <lb/>we Becuanas of old believed that we should
                    <lb/>not perish entirely at death. I dont speak
                    <lb/>of the knowledge the white man had brought
                    <lb/> I speak of the knowledge we had of old, God
                    <lb/> sent the Cameleon with a message to man
                    <lb/>saying you must not do wickedly, you must
                    <lb/>reform for when you die you will
                    <lb/>come again, you will not "nyelela hela"
                    <lb/>But the Black lizard (Katoane) was sent
                    <lb/>by the devil (Barim[  ])  as it runs fast it
                    <lb/>soon preceded the Cameleon  said to man
                    <lb/> you may live as you like, there is no
                    <lb/>God,  when you die you are gone
                    <lb/> forever, another messenger is coming 
                    <lb/>he will tell you lies, He will say you
                    <lb/> will be judged for your deeds but dont
                    <lb/>believe him - So spake the Katoane
                </p>
                <pb facs="liv_000521" n="0004"/>
                <p>Now this Mocuana after appeallin[ ] to his audienc
                    if this were not reall Bechuana belief of old
                    turned to Mr Edwards [and] myself [and] said, these
                    men are the cameleon, The devil's messengers
                    5came before them [and] has destroyed both
                    us [and] our fathers But now I beseech you
                    listen to the message of the Cameleon [and] live
                    The same individual referred also in his
                    address to the Bechuana idea of the soul [and]
                    10reasoned with his countrymen most power
                    -fully, arguing that our doctrine was
                    not new even to the people he was add
                    -ressing.   I was much pleased the other
                    day to hear from Mr Lemure that the
                    15 word he made use of to express "soul"
                    is the same as the Sesu{o}uto namely
                    Muruti or shade, not "moea" the breath
                    which as been adopted by the missionaries
                    He went so far as to describe the food
                    20 of souls in the o[ ]her world, namely
                    common flies dried in the same way
                    as is usualy done to the locusts [and] I have
                    since found that these [and] other points
                    were really the common belief of old
                    25 If you can give me any information
                    respecting their autumn creed I shall feel obliged</p>
