After school I <event>traced pencil marks in register</event>. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. <emphasis>Not a thing</emphasis>, they just took a notion to be mean." As I came across the <place>bridge</place> I <event>sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks</event>. I <event>read the Modesto paper</event>. <name role="undescribed">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read.
