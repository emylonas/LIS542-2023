He is a Man of a <aspect>warm and zealous </aspect>Spirit. It is said that he possesses considerable Property.</p>

<p>Deane says, that two Persons, of the Name of De Witt of Dutch Extraction, one in Norwich the other in Windham, have made Salt Petre with Success -- and propose to make a great deal. That there is a Mine of Lead at Middletown, which will afford a great Quantity. That Works are preparing to smelt and refine it, which will go in a fortnight. There is a Mine at Northampton, which Mr. W. Bowdoin spent much Money in working, with much Effect, tho little Profit.</p>
            
<p>Langdon and Bartlett came in this Evening, from Portsmouth. 400 Men are building a Fort on Pierce's Island to defend the Town vs. Ships of War.</p>
            
            <p>Upon recollecting the Debates of this Day in Congress, there appears to me a remarkable Want of judgment in some of our Members. Chace is <aspect> violent and boisterous</aspect>, asking his Pardon. He is <aspect>tedious</aspect> upon frivolous Points. So is E. Rutledge. Much precious Time is indiscreetly expended. Points of little Consequence are started, and debated [with] warmth. Rutledge is a <aspect>very uncouth, and ungracefull</aspect> Speaker. He shruggs his Shoulders, distorts his Body, nods and wriggles with his Head, and looks about <pb n="p03"/> with his Eyes, from side to side, and Speaks thro his Nose, as the Yankees Sing. His Brother John dodges his Head too, rather disagreably, and both of them Spout out their Language in a rough and rapid Torrent, but without much Force or Effect.</p>
            
            <p>Dyer is long <aspect>winded and roundabout -- obscure and cloudy.  Very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy Man, means and judges well.</aspect></p>
            
            <p>Sherman's <aspect>Air is the Reverse of Grace</aspect>. There cannot be a more striking Contrast to beautifull Action, than the Motions of his Hands. Generally, he stands upright with his Hands before him. The fingers of his left Hand clenched into a Fist, and the Wrist of it, grasped with his right. But he has a <aspect>clear Head and sound judgment</aspect>. But when he moves a Hand, in any thing like Action, Hogarths Genuis could not have invented a Motion more opposite to grace. It is <aspect>Stiffness, and Aukwardness </aspect>itself. <aspect>Rigid</aspect> as Starched Linen or Buckram. <aspect> Aukward</aspect> as a junior Batchelor, or a Sophomore.</p>
            
<p>Mr. Dickinsons Air, <alternates><sic>Gate</sic><corr>gait</corr></alternates>, and Action are not much more elegant.</p>

    <p>Walking to the Statehouse this Morning, I met Mr. Dickinson, on Foot in Chesnut Street. We met, and passed near enough to touch Elbows. He passed without moving his Hat, or Head or Hand. I bowed and pulled off my Hat. He passed <aspect>hautily</aspect> by. The Cause of his Offence, is the Letter no doubt which Gage has printed in Drapers Paper.</p>

<p>I shall for the future pass him, in the same manner. But I was determined to make my Bow, that I might know his Temper.</p>

<p>We are not to be upon speaking Terms, nor bowing Terms, for the time to come.</p>

<p>This Evening had Conversation with Mr. Bullock of Georgia. -- I asked him, whether Georgia had a Charter? What was the Extent of the Province? What was their Constitution? How justice was ad ministered? Who was Chancellor, who Ordinary? and who judges?</p>

<p>He says they have County Courts for the Tryal of civil Causes under 8. -- and a C. [Chief] Justice, appointed from Home and 3 other judges appointed by the Governor, for the decision of all other Causes civil and criminal, at Savanna. That the Governor alone is both Chancellor and Ordinary.</p>

    <p>Parson Gordon of Roxbury, spent the Evening here. -- I fear his <aspect>indiscreet Prate</aspect> will do harm in this City. He is an <aspect>eternal Talker</aspect>, and somewhat <aspect>vain</aspect>, and <aspect> not accurate nor judicious</aspect>. <aspect>Very zealous</aspect> in the Cause, and <aspect>a well meaning Man</aspect>, but <aspect> incautious, and not sufficiently tender of the Character</aspect> of our Province, upon which at this Time much depends. Fond of being thought a Man of Influence, at Head Quarters, and with our Council and House, and with the general Officers of the Army, and also with Gentlemen in this City, and other Colonies. -- He is a <aspect>good</aspect> Man, but <aspect> wants</aspect> a Guide.</p></entry>

<p>Mr. Smith, Mr. Imlay and Mr. Hanson, breakfasted with us. Smith is an Englishman,Imlay and Hanson N. Yorkers.
    Heard <alternates><sic>Sprout</sic><corr>Sproat</corr></alternates>,<quote><cite> on 3 Tit. 5. </cite>Not by Works of Righteousness, which We have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us, through the Washing of Regeneration and the Renewing of the holy Ghost.</quote></p>
    
    <p>There is a great deal of Simplicity and Innocence in this <aspect> worthy</aspect> Man, but <aspect> very little Elegance or Ingenuity</aspect>. -- In Prayer, he hangs his Head in an Angle of 45 over his right Shoulder. In Sermon, which is delivered without Notes, he throws himself into 
        <pb n="p06"/> a Variety of indecent Postures. Bends his Body, Points his Fingers, and throws about his Arms, without any Rule or Meaning at all. He is <aspect>totally destitute of the Genius and Eloquence </aspect>of Duffil [Duffield], has <aspect>no Imagination, No Passions, no Wit,</aspect> <deletion>[and very little]</deletion> <aspect>no Taste</aspect> and very <aspect>little Learning</aspect>, but a great deal of <aspect>Goodness of Heart.</aspect></p></entry></entries></journal>
