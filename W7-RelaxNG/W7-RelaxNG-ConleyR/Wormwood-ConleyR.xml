Laughed at <name role="student"/><name>Joe</name> and <name role="student"/><name>Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name role="student"/><name>Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name role="acquaintance"/><name>John</name> <name role="sister"/><name>Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name role="sister"/><name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name role="student"/><name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name role="student"/><name>Peek</name>'s brought <name role="student"/><name>Mary</name> and <name role="student"/><name>Nellie</name> home. <name role="acquaintance"/><name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted.

After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name role="student"/><name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise.

Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name role="sister"/><name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name role="student"/><name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name role="sister"/><name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name role="student"/><name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="pastor"/><name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="pastor"/><name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="student"/><name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over</p>

Made short talk about conduct of <refer-to-previous-entry when="1896-01-31" DOW="Friday"/> Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name role="student"/><name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
