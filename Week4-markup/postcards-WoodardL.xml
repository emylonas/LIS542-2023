        <graphic detail="caption">Holloway Hall Bell Tower
            Salisbury State College
            Salisbury, Maryland
            The center section of Holloway Hall at Salisbury State
            College, including the noble bell tower atop which one can
            scan the historical city of Salisbury in its entirety, was
            completed in 1929. Students and townspeople alike are
            enriched by lyrical sounds emanating from the tower's 
            Carillon of Bells, presented to the College by the Alumni
            Association on November 5, 1973.</graphic>

            Pleasant having your 
            company. Next time make
            it longer so that we
            can all get out and explore
            the peninsula together.
            Thanks for all the goodies!
            Am sure you managed
            to show yourself a good 
            time in Baltimore, cooled
            off a mite (degree or 2)
            Be well, — and Love,
