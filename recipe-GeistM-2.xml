        <introduction>Haddock is a mild-tasting, flaky white fish similar to cod. Here it is baked
            to perfection atop a sweet cherry tomato sauce spiked with salty capers and olives. Pair
            it with some crusty bread to soak up the juices.</introduction>

    <directions>
        <step number="1">Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the cherry tomatoes, white wine,
            olives, 3 of the garlic cloves, capers, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of
            pepper in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.</step>
        <step number="2">Pat the haddock fillets dry with a paper towel and season the flesh side
            with the Italian seasoning, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Nestle
            the fillets into the sauce in the baking dish. Bake until the sauce is bubbling around
            the edges and the fillets are cooked through and easily flaked with a fork, 15 to 20
            minutes.</step>
        <step number="3">Meanwhile, mix the remaining 1 garlic clove with the olive oil, 1/4
            teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Brush both sides of each slice
            of bread with the oil mixture and place onto a baking sheet. Bake until the bread is
            toasted, 5 to 7 minutes.</step>
        <step number="4">Serve the fish on plates with the sauce and bread on the side.</step>
